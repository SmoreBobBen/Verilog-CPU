# Verilog-CPU
A 5-stage pipelined processor written in Verilog. This project is meant as practice in programming, debugging, and compiling Verilog code. As such, I do not intend for it to become anything groundbreaking, though I will see what I learn to do through the creation process.

## Usage
The processor is designed for the RISC-V open-standard instruction set architecture, as the reduced instruction set and fixed instruction bit-width simplifies the processor design.
